        "In this lab we will explore some of the fundamental information retrieval concepts we saw in the lectures including indexing, ranked and boolean retrieval. You are given a small dataset of 737 news stories scraped from the **BBC Sports website** between 2004 and 2005 (full dataset [here](http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html)). Your task is to write a basic search engine in Python, using the Boolean Retrieval model we talked about in lectures. \n",
        "Your engine should consist of an indexer which processes all documents and creates an index as well a query engine that takes a query string and returns a list of documents that contains all the terms."

But Sturrock has distanced himself from the position. \"We're in a difficult situation. We must get out of it through the efforts of current personnel,\" said Thompson. \"Ian McCall and I have had a long and detailed talk about a number of areas including the current league position and the manner of the exit from the League Cup,\" he added. \"However, the continuing speculation is doing no one any good, especially as we have several crucial games coming up. \"The minds of the coaching staff and the players have to be on those games and those games only. \"Our season would of course improve considerably if in the next few weeks we achieved some improved league results and there is also the potential of another cup semi-final, subject to the draw.\n",

            "\n",
            "On Saturday, Sturrock insisted that he had unfinished business with Wednesday, who are fourth in League One. \"I've only been here five months and I don't expect to be leaving very, very soon,\" he said. \"I can appreciate the rumours because I've emphasised my thoughts and ambitions to go back to Dundee United. \"I can assure you the timescale is not the right one. \"It (Dundee United) is my team. I had five years there as a coach, six as a player, two years as a manager - once you've done that kind of thing, it's the result you look for. \"The important thing now is I've come here to do a job and I'm going to try to finish it.\"\n"

            "\n",
            "On Saturday, Sturrock insisted that he had unfinished business with Wednesday, who are fourth in League One. \"I've only been here five months and I don't expect to be leaving very, very soon,\" he said. \"I can appreciate the rumours because I've emphasised my thoughts and ambitions to go back to Dundee United. \"I can assure you the timescale is not the right one. \"It (Dundee United) is my team. I had five years there as a coach, six as a player, two years as a manager - once you've done that kind of thing, it's the result you look for. \"The important thing now is I've come here to do a job and I'm going to try to finish it.\"\n",
